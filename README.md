# microsrv

coffee-related api microservice

[![Build Status](http://drone.kates.test/api/badges/inherently/microsrv/status.svg)](http://drone.kates.test/inherently/microsrv)

## Description

This is a learning exercise for Go. Practical applications are limited to non-existent.

## Storage

Eventually database(s) will be supported. For now there is only a mock data store.

## Docs

After running it, you can access the /docs endpoint to see docs auto-generated by go-swagger.

## Usage

I went to the effort to include docs, please read them, they're pretty self-explanatory.

## Docker image

There is a docker image generated by the included Dockerfile. I have not published it yet but eventually I will.

## Makefile

There is a Makefile to help me do things such as regenerate docs, build, run, install the project.
