# microsrv

coffee-related api microservices


## Description

This is a learning exercise for Go. Practical applications are limited to non-existent.

## Storage

Eventually database(s) will be supported. For now there is only a mock data store.

## Docs

After running it, you can access the /docs endpoint on apisrv to see docs auto-generated by go-swagger.

## Docker images

There are docker images that can be generated by the included Dockerfiles. Publish status ranges from testing-only to non-existent.

## Makefiles

There are Makefiles to help me do things such as regenerate docs, build, run, install the projects.
